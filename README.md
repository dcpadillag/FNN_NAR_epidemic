# COVID-19 Infection Forecasting using Neural Networks

This project implements machine learning models to forecast the evolution of COVID-19 infections using both real epidemiological data and synthetic data generated by an extended SIR model. Two types of neural network architectures were developed and tested: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. All models were built and trained using PyTorch.

## Overview

The motivation behind this project was to explore the potential of neural networks for predicting temporal dynamics in epidemiological data, particularly in contexts where traditional compartmental models like SIR might fall short due to unobserved dynamics or data noise.

The main objectives were:
- To simulate plausible infection trajectories using a customized SIR-type model.
- To use these synthetic trajectories, along with real-world data, to train predictive models.
- To evaluate the performance of FNN and NAR architectures on short-term forecasting tasks.
